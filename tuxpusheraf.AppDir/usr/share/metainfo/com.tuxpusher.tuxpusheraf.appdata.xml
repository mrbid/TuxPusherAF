	<summary>A fun coin pusher game featuring Tux & Friends!</summary>
	<description>
		<p>Gotta pocket 'em all, Linux Tux! Push the 6 unique Tux figurines into the gold and silver pockets at the end of the pitch before you run out of gold and silver coins! It's always a gamble, and your starting hand is make or break!</p>
		<p>Game mechanics that will serve you well to know and use to your advantage.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Getting a gold coin in a silver slot rewards you 2x silver coins.</li>
			<li>Getting a gold coin in a gold slot rewards you 2x gold coins.</li>
			<li>Getting a tux in a slot when you already have the tux gives you 6x gold coins and 6x silver coins.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Controls: Just move around your mouse and click to release a coin.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Left Click = Release coin.</li>
			<li>Right Click = Show/Hide cursor.</li>
			<li>C = Orthographic/Perspective.</li>
			<li>F = FPS to console.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is a command line option that allows you to set the coin deployment speed, but also every time you "lose" a game, the new round will start with a faster deployment speed than the last, just to keep things exciting. ;)</p>
